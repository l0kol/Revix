# Revix

Revix envisions a decentralized infrastructure that allows content creators—particularly on YouTube—to tokenize their intellectual property (IP) and verify revenue in a trust-minimized, cryptographically verifiable way. This enables creators to register monetized content as real-world assets (RWAs) on the Story blockchain, opening the door for new financial opportunities such as loans, investments, and revenue-sharing agreements.

**Core Concept:**

The system leverages OAuth authentication and YouTube’s API to verify content ownership and revenue metrics, then signs and stores this data on-chain through a smart contract. By binding the authenticated YouTube account to a Web3 wallet, the system establishes a provable link between off-chain IP and on-chain identity. This allows creators to register content as verifiable digital assets on the [Story](https://www.story.foundation/) blockchain network.

**Why It Matters:**

This project addresses the challenges of digital creators who generate value through content but are unable to leverage it as financial collateral due to the lack of transparent, verifiable ownership and revenue records. By creating a secure data bridge between Web2 platforms like YouTube and decentralized networks, we empower creators to access capital, prove asset value, and participate in on-chain economies.

## Features

1. **Web2-Linked Ownership Verification:** Uses OAuth tokens and YouTube API to confirm that a user owns the video content they claim, then signs this proof via their wallet.
2. **Revenue Attestation Engine:** Fetches authenticated revenue data (e.g., ad earnings) from YouTube and generates verifiable proofs of income that are recorded on-chain.
3. **Smart Contract-Based IP Registry:** All ownership and revenue proofs are stored immutably on the Story network, enabling secondary use cases like tokenization, lending, and royalty splitting.
4. **Wallet-Linked Creator Identity:** Binds verified IP and revenue data to the creator’s crypto wallet, establishing a durable, decentralized identity and asset history.

This solution sets the foundation for a decentralized creator economy where digital IP can be transparently verified, collateralized, and integrated into broader financial ecosystems—unlocking new tools for monetization, investment, and community-driven funding.
